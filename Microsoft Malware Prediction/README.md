## Abstract 

- Host : Mirosoft 
- Objective : Predict if a machine will soon be hit with malware (Classification)
- Evaluation : AUC
- Period :  2019.01.01 ~ 2019.03.13

The malware industry continues to be a well-organized, well-funded market dedicated to evading traditional security measures. Once a computer is infected by malware, criminals can hurt consumers and enterprises in many ways.

With more than *one billion* enterprise and consumer customers, [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com/) takes this problem very seriously and is deeply invested in improving security.

As one part of their overall strategy for doing so, Microsoft is challenging the data science community to develop techniques to predict if a machine will soon be hit with malware. As with their previous, [Malware Challenge (2015)](https://www.kaggle.com/c/malware-classification), Microsoft is providing Kagglers with an unprecedented malware dataset to encourage open-source progress on effective techniques for predicting malware occurrences.

Can you help protect more than one billion machines from damage BEFORE it happens?
